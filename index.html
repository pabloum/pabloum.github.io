    <h3>About me</h3>
    <div class="description">
      <p>I am a <strong>Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineer</strong>, graduated in Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana in Medellín, Colombia. During the study of these amazing degrees, I realized that my passion was programming. So, I decided to start learning several programming languages in order to be able to work as a developer. It is my dream. </p>
      <p>In the university I learned <strong>Matlab</strong> and <strong>C</strong>. And after getting my degree I started to lean autodidactly Java and Python. Then I got the opportunity to enter to Make it Real to learn <strong>Web Developing with Rails</strong>. Then I received the opportunity to go to a training in <strong>C++</strong> in the company Globant. That was where it all started.</p>
      <p>Then I started participating and creating my own projects. </p>
      <p>My greatest hobby is to learn <strong>new languages</strong>. I speak fluently <strong>English, French and Spanish (nativ)</strong>. Besides, I have average level of <strong>German</strong> and basics of Italian. </p>
    </div>

    <h3>What I do</h3>
    <p>I am currentlya attending to a Full Stack on Rails course and a C++ training. My goal is to learn as much as I can about those two topics. I would love to start working as a professional developer very soon. </p>
