      <p>I am a Mechanical and Aeronautical Engineer, graduated in Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana in Medell√≠n, Colombia. During the study of these amazing degrees, I realized that my passion eas programming. So, I decided to start learning several programming languages in order to be able to work as a developer. It was my dream. </p>
      <p>In the university I learnt Matlab and C. And after getting my degree I started to lean autodidactly Java and Python. Then I got the opportunity to enter to Make it Real to learn Web Developing with Rails. Then I received the opportunity to go to a training in C++ in the company Globant. That was where it all started.</p>
      <p>Then I started participating and creating my own projects. </p>
